    "description": "A concert that starts the whole story of URFO ......\nURFO Founder Brian planned this concert with music from C.P.E. Bach, Mendelssohn, Rachmaninoff and Chopin. The concert was opened by C.P.E. Bach's Flute Concerto, performed by guest flutists William and Jiayi Ye, accompanied by guest violinists Amy and Ziyin Lin. Then, violinist Patricia proceeded the concert with a moving performance of Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in e minor, accompanied by Mr. Zhu. After a short intermission, the concert continues with Rachmaninoff's famous Piano Concerto No.2, performed by pianist Lindsay and was finally concluded by Brian giving a virtuoso yet rich-textured Chopin's Piano Concerto No.1.",

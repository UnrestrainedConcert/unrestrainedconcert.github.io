    "description": "When 'Unrestrained' is officially THE 'Unrestrained'...\nThe whole concert featured chamber music and concerto, with Emma and Roy each delivered a string concerto as the concluding musician of the first and second part. The third segment of concert was astonishing, opened by the moving 'Trout' quintet, following by the virtuous Beethoven Violin Concerto performed by Patricia, and the deep and colorful Prokofiev Piano Concerto No. 2 delivered by Brian as the Grand Finale.",

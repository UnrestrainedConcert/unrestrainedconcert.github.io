## UNRESTRAINED FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA
Welcome to one of the coolest student-run orchestras in the world! This is our orchestra official website repo.  
We are Unrestrained Festival Orchestra (or be short, URFO). We consist of the most enthusiast and proficient amateur musicians from Shanghai, or in the future, the world.  
As you may find out, this website repo is not complete. There aren't vue build files, etc. Well, this is an act of desperation since we must encrypt some of the musicians-only contents, not only to prevent programs from being leaked earliar than our plan, but also to protect the copyright of URFO composers, as well as other copyright-protected composers which we will be or have performed their works.  
If you are interested in maintaining this website, contact hellobrian18@gmail.com for more information.  
Finally, enjoy the (half) opened source code, and the beautiful website!
